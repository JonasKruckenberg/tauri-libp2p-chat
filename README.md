# Tauri & Libp2p chat demo

This demo shows how to integrate a libp2p node with tauri. 
The node discovers other peers over the local network via MDNS and creates a floodsub network that lets you exchange messages.

## Getting started
1. clone the repo
2. install the dependencies with `yarn`
3. start the app multiple times with `yarn tauri:dev`
4. Get chatting!
